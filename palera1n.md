sudo chmod +x palera1n
```

<br/>

**Step 4**<br/>
```
sudo xattr -c palera1n
```

<br/>

**Step 5**<br/>
Connect your iPhone to your computer.
```
./palera1n -c -f
```

<br/>

**Step 6**
```
./palera1n -f
```

<br/>

**Step 7**<br/>
Follow the steps and click Install when the app is on your iPhone.

> Note: I had some issues where there would be an error saying failed to get in to DFU mode. If you continue as if the error didn't happen the jailbreak still works. 

> Note: I also had an error where the exploit would stop on pongoOS. You can hit control+c and re-run palera1n to continue.
