**Step 1**<br/>
I'm using an iPhone SE device on iOS 11.2.1. This guide was very helpful.
- https://ios.cfw.guide/installing-unc0ver/

<br/>

**Step 2**<br/>
- Install sideloadly - https://sideloadly.io/ 
- Install unc0ver 5.3.1 - https://unc0ver.dev/downloads/5.3.1/72004596b31ba3eae886ac6cc781725879d3b7a4/unc0ver_5.3.1.ipa

<br/>

**Step 3**<br/>
Use sideloadly to install the IPA file on you device

<br/>

**Step 4**<br/>
Trust the Application on the iPhone by going to General > Device Management. Select the Electra application and click "trust".

<br/>

**Step 5**<br/>
Open unc0ver and click jailbreak.

<br/>

**Note**<br/>
> I had some issues jailbreaking. In the unc0ver setting there is a setting to restore rootFS. This was the only solution to countless error when try to jailbreak using unc0ver and Electra.
